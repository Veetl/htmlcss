# My cross-course project

A store where you can trade, buy or sell games.   

## Description

The idea of the site is to make a market for anyone who want to get their hands on games that might no longer be sold in ordinary stores. There is a lot of people who collect old games, and there are people who look for games they played when they were younger. 
For anyone that does not care about buying, there is the option of selling. There might be a lot of users that wants to sell their old belongings and is just collecting dust or taking up a lot of space in their room.
